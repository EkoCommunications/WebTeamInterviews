### Amity Web Team Interviews

> Welcome to the Web Team! This is a repo to perform code reviews and provide documents while in interview.

In there you'll find:

1. A mockup spec of the User service to discuss with a candidate.
2. A branch named "code-review" to perform fake code reviews with a candidate.

#### Mockup specs

You can use the markdown preview to showcase the spec.

#### Code review

To prepare for the code review, simply open a PR from 'code-review' to 'main' and ask the candidate to share their screen and do the review live. **At the end of the interview you can close the PR.**
